# AutoSurfing

This is created for trying WebSockets.

AutoSurfing was created when WebSockets Protocol was draft, so I think it's doesn't work now.

AutoSurfing can surf the Internet with AutoSurfing users like an old television.

If an user opens the web page in AutoSurfing tab, other AutoSurfing users also open same page.
